          The idea is:

          If vx < 0:
            calculate tc ONLY IF particle is on the right side (crash the middle wall from the right)
          If vx > 0
            calculate tc ONLY IF particle is on the left side (crash the middle wall from the left)
          if any of this conditions is match, return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY to represent that, with the current
          system's conditions, it is not possible that the particle hits a middle wall.

          Supposing we got a non infinite tc, we proceed to check the new y position.
          Notice that we got the tc that matches the condition where the center of the particle/point is at distance
          R from the middle wall.

          For simplification purpose, we will consider the particle's MBB (Minimum Bounding Box) instead of the
          particle itself. This simplification is due to the fact that, if not, we should resolve a quadratic
          equation with the time as the unknown variable, and the complexity of this is out of our scope.
          For more information about how to get the exact distance of the particle to a certain figure, check
          the following link: http://www.learnopengl.com/#!In-Practice/2D-Game/Collisions/Collision-Detection

          OK, back on our argument, we should check if the newY +- the particle's radio will collide with a
          middle wall or it is able to pass across the opening. And that's exactly what we do.
          If collision is detected, the tc return is the previously found; if not, tc is set to POSITIVE_INFINITE, as
          there won't be any collision for this particle with any middle wall.

          With all this in mind, we go on to implement the above's logic.
